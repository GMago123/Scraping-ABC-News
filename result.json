    "content": "The US is suspending a tariff hike on $US250 billion ($368 billion) in Chinese imports that was set to take effect on Tuesday, and China agreed to buy $40 billion to $50 billion in US farm products as the world's two biggest economies reached a ceasefire in their 15-month trade war.\nThe White House said the two sides made some progress on the thornier issues, including China's lax protection of foreign intellectual property.\nBut more progress will have to be made on key differences in later negotiations, including US allegations China forces foreign countries to hand over trade secrets in return for access to the Chinese market.\nUS President Donald Trump announced the trade truce in a White House meeting with the top Chinese negotiator, Vice-Premier Liu He.\nThe news followed two days of talks in Washington.\n\"You're very tough negotiators,\" Mr Trump said to the Chinese delegation.\n\"It took us a long time to get here, but it's something that's going to be great for China and great for the USA.\"\nMr Trump was yet to change plans to impose tariffs on December 15 on an additional $160 billion in Chinese products, a move that would extend the sanctions to just about everything China ships to the US.\nThe December 15 tariffs would cover a wide range of consumer goods, including clothes, toys and smartphones and would likely be felt by American shoppers.\nWhile providing scant details of just what was agreed to on Friday, the White House said Beijing had pledged to be more transparent about how it set the value of its currency, the yuan.\nThe administration has accused China of manipulating the yuan lower to give its exporters a competitive advantage in foreign markets.\nChina also agreed to open its markets to US banks and other financial services providers, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.\nStill, nervous financial markets welcomed the prospect of reduced tensions between Washington and Beijing.\nBefore Friday's meeting, Mr Trump posted on Twitter that he would \"like to see something significant happen\".\n\"One of the great things about the China Deal is the fact that, for various reasons, we do not have to go through the very long and politically complex Congressional Approval Process,\" he said. \n\"When the deal is fully negotiated, I sign it myself on behalf of our Country. Fast and Clean!\"\nEarlier on Friday, local time, China announced a timetable for carrying out a promise to allow full foreign ownership of some finance businesses, starting with futures traders on January 1, as Beijing tries to make its slowing economy more competitive and efficient.\nOwnership limits will be ended for mutual fund companies on April 1 and for securities firms on December 1, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said.\nUntil now, foreign investors have been limited to owning 51 per cent of such businesses.\nFor now, the two sides have come to \"almost a complete agreement\" on both financial services and currency issues, Mr Mnuchin said.\nSpeaking from Fiji, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison hailed the agreement as a \"good thing\" and welcomed \"somewhat of a breakthrough\".\n\"As you know, I've been encouraging both the United States and China to get on and get this done,\" he said.\nMr Morrison said he contacted Mr Mnuchin immediately after he heard the news.\n\"I said congratulations. I'm very pleased he's been able to get this done,\" Mr Morrison said.\n\"Sometimes people have been critical of me for this, but I've always been optimistic about this.\n\"I commend both China and the United States on where they've got to.\"\nUS stocks ended more than 1 per cent higher on Friday, however, were well off the day's highs.\nWord of the trade concessions filtered out in the last half-hour of trading and pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average 517 points higher, though the momentum faded near the close.\nOnce the White House announced the tentative accord, the market shed some of its gains.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average, which had risen more than 500 points at its high, closed up 319.\nThe timing of the trade news had a lot to do with the late-day volatility, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities Michael James said. \n\"There were 15 minutes to go in the trading day on a Friday… after the Dow had risen 700 points in the last two days,\" he said. \n\"Anything that was less than a comprehensive agreement was likely to see some degree of market sell off.\"\nMyron Brilliant, executive vice-president of the US Chamber of Commerce, drew encouragement from Friday's developments.\n\"Finally, a ray of hope for the US-China trade relationship,\" he said.\n\"While there remains significant work ahead to address many of the most important US trade and investment priorities, we will continue to lend our full support.\"\nStill, Gregory Daco, an economist at Oxford Economics, suggested the partial nature of the deal won't relieve much of the uncertainty surrounding trade policy that has discouraged many American companies from investing in new equipment and expanding. \n\"For businesses this will mean less damage, not greater certainty,\" Mr Daco said in a research note.\nMr Daco estimated the trade fight would cut US growth by about 0.6 percentage points in 2020.\nFriday's pact might reduce that slightly to 0.5 percentage point, he said.\n\"Beyond the promises and niceties, the deal doesn't address key underlying issues,\" Mr Daco wrote.\nThe two countries are deadlocked primarily over the Trump administration's assertions that China deploys predatory tactics — including outright theft — in a sharp-elbowed drive to become the global leader in robotics, self-driving cars and other advanced technology.\nBeijing has been reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that would satisfy the administration.\nDoing so would likely require scaling back China's aspirations for technological supremacy, which it sees as crucial to its prosperity.\nAP/Reuters\n"

    "content": "When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Sydneysider Reed Davies' work hours and income were slashed by more than half and he spent nearly three weeks isolated in his apartment.\nFrustrated and lonely, 25-year-old Mr Davies sought help from his mother Jane Davies, who lives in Darwin.\nShe encouraged her son to fly to the NT to be with family in a city which had no community transmission and a low rate of COVID-19.\nMr Davies said he told police at Darwin Airport he planned to isolate at his parents' house, but officers said he would need to do the 14 days' quarantine at a hotel instead. In line with the NT Government's coronavirus border restrictions, Mr Davies would also need to pay the $2,500 hotel fee himself.\nMr Davies said communication was poor from the moment he arrived at the airport, with officers unable to answer his questions about the quarantine procedure. \n\"You're on edge when you get off the plane, it's anxiety inducing,\" he said. \n\"And I felt like I was being treated like a criminal.\"\nBut while Mr Davies was in hotel quarantine in Darwin CBD, Ms Davies said police arrived at her apartment just one suburb away — as their records showed the 25-year-old was with her.\n\"It was a shambles,\" Ms Davies said.\nThe Davies family also said they did not know they could have applied for an exemption to mandatory quarantine until after Mr Davies had already arrived in Darwin.\nGiven Mr Davies' income had dropped below $52,000, he would have been eligible to apply for an exemption.\nNT Health Minister Natasha Fyles said 8,000 people had been granted a quarantine exemption to date, meaning they did not have to go into mandatory hotel quarantine on arrival in the NT.\nBut the NT Government's COVID-19 team said the figure was actually higher. \n\"Since the closure of the borders there have been more than 18,000 discrete crossings into the Territory,\" a spokeswoman said. \n\"More than 11,000 of these discrete crossings were covered by a quarantine exemption issued by the Chief Health Officer.\"\nThe NT Chief Health Officer has the authority to issue exemptions to vulnerable people who may face negative health outcomes or financial hardship from being quarantined in a hotel rather than at home.\nMs Fyles said many of the exemptions had been for essential workers, such as police officers, health workers and Defence personnel.\nShe also acknowledged there had been lengthy delays processing some applications. \n\"It has been difficult for Health to manage, and we apologise for situations like that where someone has lodged the form but, in the meantime, they've entered the Territory and they've had to spend a night or two in quarantine,\" she said.\n\"But these measures are about protecting Territorians.\"\nThe Davies family said they wanted the NT Government to communicate better with arrivals in the NT, and to be more transparent about who exactly could apply for an exemption. \n\"It's a difficult time, and it would make a huge difference to have information there and to be able to have your questions answered,\" Mr Davies said. \nWhile Mr Davies was in hotel quarantine, the family submitted an exemption form, hoping to avoid paying the $2,500 hotel fee.\nThe family said many of their phone calls to the NT's COVID-19 question line involved lengthy delays and conflicting information.\n\"We did that four weeks ago and we've never had any feedback,\" Ms Davies said. \n"

    "content": "Had the great Greek philosopher Aristotle been an economic pundit in 2016 he may well have said something pithy like, \"One swallow does not a summer make; similarly, one quarter of negative GDP does not make an economy recessionary\".\nCertainly the September quarter's -0.5 per cent reverse makes for glum reading, but it is hardly a harbinger of recession and an economic winter setting in.\nLooking back at previous negative quarters dotted sparsely through the past 25 years of largely economic expansion points more to the likelihood of a subsequent growth spurt than autumnal senescence.\nOver the past 100 quarters there have been just four where the economy has gone backwards as measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics' \"gross domestic product, chain volume measures (percentage change)\".\nThe last instance was a 0.2 per cent decline in March 2011 following the devastating summer storms which inundated southern Queensland.\nTowns were wiped out, around 200,000 people were affected, coal mines were flooded and around $40 billion was wiped off GDP after weeks of flooding rains over the Christmas-New Year period of 2010/2011.\nThe subsequent quarter, reported strong GDP growth of 1.1 per cent and at least 1 per cent growth a quarter over the next 12 months.\nThe GFC hit in the December quarter of 2008 with GDP registering -0.7 per cent. Once again, GDP rebounded 1.1 per cent in March 2009.\nEight years earlier, December 2000 coughed up a -0.3 per cent result in response to the introduction of the GST six months earlier.\nConsumers went on strike and a technical recession was narrowly avoided, with the September quarter having recorded zero growth.\nBut that did not last long - the urge to spend was too strong and GDP rebounded by 1.1 per cent in the March quarter.\nBefore that was the 1991 double header; Australia's last recession and famously, as then treasurer Paul Keating said, \"a recession that Australia had to have\".\nGrowth in the June and March quarters retreated 0.1 and 1.3 per cent respectively.\nThe rebound out of that was far more sluggish, but the whole economy was pretty wobbly back then, with four of the seven quarters from December 1989 negative, as interest rates soared and businesses collapsed.\nThere are a few basic reasons why recessions occur according to Market Economics' Stephen Koukoulas, and none of them point to an impending problem in Australia.\n\"It can come from a policy error, and we don't have that,\" Mr Koukoulas said.\n\"It can be a global shock, such as the GFC, but globally things are improving and commodity prices are rising.\n\"Then there are internal issues, specific to an economy, like banks lending too much, but that isn't happening either.\n\"That doesn't mean a recession won't happen, there is always a risk, but it doesn't seem likely.\"\nWhy did the economy go backwards in the last quarter?\nPerhaps the simplest explanation is that GDP readings in the first half of the year were unrealistically strong.\n\"Having had a surprisingly good first half, we've had a surprisingly bad quarter,\" Mr Koukoulas said.\nMorgan Stanley's Daniel Blake predicted a negative quarter some time ago and noted his forecast didn't reflect recessionary dynamics, but rather a correction of earlier \"overstated growth\".\n\"We have been arguing that Australia's 'real GDP' of 3.3 per cent year-on-year feels overstated, with the sharp decline in commodity prices driving an 'income recession' over 2014-15,\" Mr Blake wrote in a recent note.\n\"More recently both the first and second quarter results benefited from 'one-offs' - notably a benign cyclone season for exports, a surprise boost to public spending (including on helicopters) and a (positive) inventory build.\"\nAnd they are pretty well the bits of economy that chopped chunks out of GDP this time. Weak capex, weak government spending and weak net exports all did the damage.\nWhile history points to a solid rebound next March, it is far from a certainty.\nOn the favourable side of the leger, policy settings are still easy; interest rates are low and likely to stay that way for some time.\nCommodity prices are improving and the terms of trade are on the way back up from historic lows.\nThe Reserve Bank cut itself some slack in keeping interest rates on hold in December by noting growth may dip in the near term, before the higher commodity prices \"provide a boost to national income\".\nWeighing against this, wages growth remains weak, unemployment could start edging up again and there is mounting evidence the residential construction boom may have peaked, or at least is about to peak.\nSo, while the economy is not necessarily going backwards, or even stalled, it certainly is not changing up through the gears and accelerating out of its below trend growth just yet.\nThe betting remains the RBA may still need to cut interest rates a bit more next year to head off another reverse in GDP and the possibility of recession.\n"

    "content": "Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic has been an experience unlike anything else in Northern Territory Police Commander Tony Fuller's 30-year career.\nCommander Fuller is the incident controller at Darwin's emergency operations centre, which has most commonly been set up for cyclone and flooding emergencies.\n\"It's something that I never would have thought I'd do in my career,\" Commander Fuller said.\n\"It's obviously challenging, there's no rule book written on this one.\"\nCommander Fuller said his team had been formulating plans within 48 hours that would usually take up to three months to develop.\n\"Obviously we'll make mistakes,\" he said.\n\"But the ultimate game is to try and stop the virus spreading into our community and trying to protect those people who are vulnerable to the virus and stop them from dying.\"\nTo do that, police in the NT — like their counterparts around the country — now have power to hand out on-the-spot fines for things that were part of everyday life just weeks ago, like having friends over for dinner.\nThe politicians have more power too — the NT Government is taking fast action to confront the pandemic without having to explain itself to a parliamentary chamber, which is sitting empty after adjourning for the foreseeable future.\nSo what are the rules for this crisis and who is keeping score?\nThe NT Parliament has passed several amendments to existing laws so it can put its coronavirus health and budget measures in place.\nSix months of appropriations and \"contingency\" funds — $3.4 billion in total — have been released and the requirement to publish a pre-election fiscal outlook has been removed.\nThe NT Health Minister's ability to declare a public health emergency, an existing power, has been changed to allow the declarations to last for 90 days with extensions if needed.\nThere are also amendments to the NT's Information Act, which sets out how public sector organisations can collect, use and disclose personal information.\nThese laws already allowed public sector organisations to deal with personal information in a way that could breach privacy principles if the reasons relate to the emergency response.\nNow, this exemption applies in the same way to \"public health emergencies\".\nIn a public health emergency, the CHO Hugh Heggie is given extra legal powers and his directions during this pandemic must be followed.\nThey include limits on gatherings and aged care visits, the closure of certain businesses, border controls, forced quarantine and the procedure a person recently diagnosed with COVID-19 must follow.\nThere is also a requirement that police assist Mr Heggie in enforcing his directions.\nThe offence for breaching the CHO's directions is not new and if the matter goes to court, there's a maximum penalty of $62,800.\nBut new regulations have been passed for on-the-spot fines that police can issue for these breaches — there's a $1,099 fine for individuals and a $5,495 fine for corporations.\nShahleena Musk, a senior lawyer with the Human Rights Law Centre said she was worried a lack of accessible information about the laws could result in \"heavy-handedness\" and inappropriate responses from both residents and authorities.  \nShe wants a legal information campaign — similar to the health information has been given to remote community residents by land councils — to be provided for the NT's main Indigenous language groups.\n\"Many people don't know what the laws are now that exist in the Northern Territory,\" she said.\n\"I'm seeing a lot of confusion out there and uncertainty and to me that could lead to people inadvertently breaching these new laws.\n\"If we're going to ensure greater compliance, if we're going to ensure people are able to work well with our police and other enforcement bodies, there needs to be clear information,\" she said.\nAssociate Professor Michael Eburn, an Australian National University emergency law expert and former ambulance officer, said there was potential for \"overreach\" and authorities might be keen to use powers they have discovered during this crisis at a later point.\nBut he said the parliamentary process and the courts, which have not been displaced by the pandemic, remained to hold authorities using these powers to account.\n\"The parliament hasn't been suspended, the Australian Constitution hasn't been set aside, the Northern Territory Self-Government Act hasn't been set aside — all the functions of government are still there,\" he said.\nBut Mr Eburn said Australians hold onto their rights by a \"tenuous string\" without recourse to a bill of rights.\n\"At the end of the day how do you hold governments to account? You either vote for a different one or you take them to court — they're the options you've got,\" he said.\nIn response to a push for greater transparency from several non-government MLAs, the NT Treasurer has confirmed the parliament's Public Accounts Committee will meet monthly to examine the NT Government's response to COVID-19.\nSo far, the NT's coronavirus economic measures total more than $300 million, which is about 1 per cent of Gross State Product (GSP).\nThe largest portion of this amount is $180 million in forgone revenue from payroll tax cuts and power bill rebates for businesses.\nMore than $50 million has been put towards renovation grants for homes, businesses and not-for-profits and there is another $50 million for a \"survival fund\" to help small business in particular get through initial financial hardship.\nThe NT Government entered the coronavirus pandemic in the midst of a budget clampdown, after its budget repair consultant John Langoulant made recommendations to stop net debt spiralling to $35 billion over the next decade.\nMr Langoulant warned there was an urgent need to reign-in spending outside budget cycles and enforce cultural change within departments.\nDanielle Wood, an economist at the Grattan Institute, said the NT Government had little choice about the COVID-19 economic measures and they were comparable to or less than those announced in other jurisdictions. \n\"It's true that the Northern Territory's come into this with a weaker budget position than most other states or territories … it was running bigger deficits than most other states or territories,\" Ms Wood said.\n\"But this is a once-in-a-generation, if not once-in-a-century, economic event and governments need to act to support businesses and to support households, to help them bridge the shutdown period.\n\"Quite simply, the cost of not acting will punch a hole in the economy and punch a hole in budgets far worse than governments coming in to act.\"\nAlthough governments across the world have their hands tied when it comes to COVID-19 budget measures, Ms Wood said oversight was still important.\nShe said the checks and balances needed could be in the form of rigorous auditing after the fact, to reassure taxpayers their money is being used for the right purpose.\n\"I would be concerned if there were too many checks before the money could get out of the door,\" she said.\nLike other jurisdictions, the NT Government has cancelled its May budget and under its emergency measures the requirement to provide a pre-election fiscal outlook has been removed.\nUnder the NT's fixed terms of office, the next election is due on August 22 and the NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner has insisted that election will not be delayed. \nDespite the difficult circumstances, Ms Wood said voters were entitled to be provided with financial statements of some kind from the NT Treasurer before the election.\n\"It would be highly unusual to have an election and not have a pre-election financial statement,\" Ms Wood said.\n\"It's quite difficult, I think, for people to go to the polls [without it] — to me, that's a pretty crucial piece of information that voters would want to have.\"\n"
